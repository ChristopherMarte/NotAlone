    <h1>
        Hi there!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Welcome! I know you might have things to do, but before you go I wanted to share some phrases with you that might help you just like they helped me...
    </p>
    <h2>
        "You cannot be perfect; you can only do your best."
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes we believe that we should not do something just because the result will not be perfect, or we don't know the best way to do it, or we might mess up and fail. We have to undestand that messing up and learning from our mistakes is how we grow! Perfection does not exist. Just get started, after a while you'll see how far that can take you!
    </p>
    <h2>
        "Failure is our teacher, not our enemy. Embrace it, learn from it and grow." 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We tend to learn more from our mistakes than from our successes. This is why we should not be scared of failing, but rather be eager to try new things and understand that failure might occur, and that we will still learn something new from it!
    </p>
    <h2>
        "Your time will come at some point, do not lose hope." 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We can sometimes become desperate because of our circumstances, feeling like there is no way out and we should just give up. Hang in there! Nothing in life lasts forever, be it good times or bad times. Make sure to enjoy the good times, and also understand that the bad times will pass. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        "There is always something that can be learned from any experience." 
    </h2>
    <p>
        It can sometimes be easy to look at the bad side of any situation, just like it can be hard to find the good side of a bad situation. Yet we must try our best to aknowledge that there are good things to look at in any bad situation, and we can learn and grow once we are able to see this.
    </p>
    <h2>
        "Don't dwell on the past or worry about the future. If you do so, you end up not living the present."
    </h2>
    <p>
        Something that we tend to forget is that we only live through the present. The past no longer exists, only our memories of it do. The future also does not exist, it has not come to pass yet. This does not mean that we should ignore what has happened or what can happen, but that we should learn from our past mistakes so that we can work today for a better future!
    </p>
    <h2>
        "You don't need to have everything figured out, just your next step. Live life one day at a time."
    </h2>
    <p>
        To me this is probably the most important one. We so often tend to get absorbed by the bigger picture in life, that we tend to forget that we only exist in the here and now. We don't know what the future holds for us, and worrying about it only makes us anxious about the uncertainties. If we get stuck in the past, we become sad from all the things we miss or did wrong. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Only by deciding to live in the present can we truly feel happy and content. Accept what you have and be thankful, as difficult as it can sometimes be. Better times will come, you just have to do your best in the meantime.

    </p>
